# AngelCode .fnt File Generator
This standalone tool is made for Godot Engine projects. It's used for implementing bitmap fonts easier. It should work for any engine that uses .fnt files for its bitmap fonts, but it's only tested in Godot Engine projects. You have to download Godot Engine to build this tool. If you notice a bug or you have any suggestion, open an issue.
